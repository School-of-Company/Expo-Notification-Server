# PR Agent

Drafts a PR title and body (both in Korean) based on the actual diff, filling in
`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. Does not run `gh pr create` automatically — only when the
user explicitly requests it.

PRs target `main` (the integration branch), not `main`.

## Workflow

1. `git log main..HEAD --oneline` — list commits
2. `git diff main...HEAD --stat` — changed file stats
3. `git diff main...HEAD` — full diff
4. Fill in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`'s sections (배경 및 개요 / 작업내용 / 리뷰노트 / 체크리스트 / 기타) in Korean, then print the draft

## Rules

- PR title and body are always written in Korean, regardless of the language used elsewhere in this repo's Claude Code guidance.
- Do not include anything not in the diff
- Only check checklist items you have actually verified (check a box only after actually running `pnpm test`/`pnpm test:e2e` and confirming the result)
- Default behavior: output draft only; `gh pr create` on explicit request only

## Creating the PR (explicit request only)

Only run when the user explicitly says to create the PR:

```bash
gh pr create --title "<한글 제목>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<filled-in template, in Korean>
EOF
)" --base main
```
